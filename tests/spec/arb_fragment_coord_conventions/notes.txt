//need:

+compiler tests

+linker/execution (shader_runner)
 -linker tests should deal with questions directly pertinent to data between shaders, ie when they don't agree there would be a problem linking them. vs main should just do a gl_positions and access the data it was given. there does not need to be anything in fs main. at the end it should read:
  [test]
  link error
 -execution should be for command relevant testing. this would apply if there were actual functions that needed to be verified. for frag_coord_conventions this may apply if we need to verify that changing the fs layout qualifiers changes the performance (it should not)
