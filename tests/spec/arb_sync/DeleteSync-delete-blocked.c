/*
 *Test DeleteSync() can be called on a sync object with commands 
 * blocking it
 *
 *
 *Section 5.2(Sync Objects and Fences) of OpenGL 3.2 Core says:
 *"A sync object can be deleted by passing its name to the command
 * 	void DeleteSync( sync sync );
 * If the fence command corresponding to the specified sync object  
 * has completed, or if no ClientWaitSync or WaitSync commands are 
 * blocking on sync, the object is deleted immediately. Otherwise, 
 * sync is flagged for deletion and will be deleted when it is no 
 * longer associated with any fence command and is no longer
 * blocking any ClientWaitSync or WaitSync command. In either case, 
 * after returning from DeleteSync the sync name is invalid and can 
 * no longer be used to refer to the sync object."
