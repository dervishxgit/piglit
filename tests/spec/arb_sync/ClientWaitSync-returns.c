/*
 *Test ClientWaitSync() returns correct values
 *
 *
 *Section 5.2.1(Waiting for Sync Objects) of OpenGL 3.2 Core says:
 *"ClientWaitSync returns one of four status values. A return value of
 * ALREADY_SIGNALED indicates that sync was signaled at the time 
 * ClientWaitSync was called. ALREADY_SIGNALED will always be   
 * returned if sync was signaled, even if the value of timeout is 
 * zero. A return value of TIMEOUT_EXPIRED indicates that the 
 * specified timeout period expired before sync was signaled. A re-
 * turn value of CONDITION_SATISFIED indicates that sync was signaled 
 * before the timeout expired. Finally, if an error occurs, in 
 * addition to generating a GL error as specified below, 
 * ClientWaitSync immediately returns WAIT_FAILED withoutblocking."
 *
 *
 * Note: This test sporadically fails for some reason...
