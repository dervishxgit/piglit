 *Test IsSync()

 *Section 6.1.7(Sync Object Queries) of OpenGL 3.2 Core says:
 *"The command
 *	boolean IsSync( sync sync );
 * returns TRUE if sync is the name of a sync object. If sync is not the name of a sync
 * object, or if an error condition occurs, IsSync returns FALSE (note that zero is not
 * the name of a sync object)."
